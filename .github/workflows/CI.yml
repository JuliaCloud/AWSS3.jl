  # Merge queues only wait for the required status checks to pass which are defined in the
  # repository settings under the branch protection rules. Unfortunately, the required
  # status checks for PRs and merge queues must be identical even though the workflows
  # themselves are triggered separately (i.e `pull_request` vs. `merge_group`).
  #
  # In order to have a status check which allows CI jobs to be skipped in PRs but must pass
  # in the merge queue we'll make use of this separate workflow job. Additionally, this
  # works around issues with using matrix jobs as required status checks. Finally, as
  # required status checks are identified by the job name only some care should be taken to
  # ensure the job name is unique across all workflows.
